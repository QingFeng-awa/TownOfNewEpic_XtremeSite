## About TONEX
Since May 20, 2023, Town Of Host Edited (TOHE) has ceased development.<br>
To keep the "flame" of TOHE alive, we developed a branch project called Town Of Host Edited-Xi (TOHEX).<br>
However, the development of this project was not smooth sailing; our reputation continued to decline, and our efforts yielded no results.<br>
Finally, on November 17, 2023, TOHEX ceased updates indefinitely.<br>
At the request of many players, KARPED1EM decided to maintain basic compatibility for TOHE and renamed it to Town Of Next (TONX).<br>
Consequently, we improved and recreated TOHEX based on TONX, forming a new team, XtremeWave, to correct past mistakes and return with a fresh look.<br>
Thus, Town Of New Epic_Xtreme (TONEX) was born.<br>
Now, TONX has once again ceased updates, but we have restored all the content from TOHE that TONX could not complete within TONEX.<br>
Let us continue the creation of mods in the name of "INHERITANCE" once more!
